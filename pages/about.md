## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

This site features select football-related collections from the [University of Notre Dame Archives](http://archives.nd.edu/). Metadata was generated as part of Prof. Katherine Walden's F21 "Football In America" course.
